# Hello-World
Personally the first Repository

I'm struggling with my personal development and carrer right now.
How to survive this era?
How to live a life of quality at this times?
Where are we heading?
How can I make a decent living on my own?

I'm extremely fasinated by these questions above.
In fact, I've been plotting to wrtie something about them in the coming days.

Now, I'm offically landing on GitHub.
And maybe it's time for me to seriously develop something meaningful to this world.

I wanna thank God and this world for what it gives me.

Thank you so much.

I'm so grateful that I've had this invaluable chance to live on earth.
